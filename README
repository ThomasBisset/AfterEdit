AfterShot README

This script currently takes a folder of images, copies it to another directory,
then resizes the images and add's watermarks so that it is ready for uploading
to whichever website or photo-sharing service you use. It also adds appropriate 
IPTC data to all the images. 

I'm sure there are many better coders than me out there that can polish this up
and add new features, if desired. I'm still (very slowly) learning Ruby so 
suggestions and tips greatly appreciated :)

Thanks for reading!
Thomas
