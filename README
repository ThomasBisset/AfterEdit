AfterShot README

This script currently takes a folder of images, copies it to another directory,
then resizes the images and add's watermarks so that it is ready for uploading
to whichever website or photo-sharing service you use.

I hope to add a means of adding appropriate IPTC data to each file before the 
pictures are resized - this would give the original images an identifying "mark"
 (albeit an invisible one) to discourage redistribution and to aid 
identification of the photographer. 

I'm sure there are many better coders than me out there that can polish this up
and add new features, if desired. I'm still (very slowly) learning Ruby so 
suggestions and tips greatly appreciated :)

Thanks for reading!
Thomas
